I’m an IT security specialist focused on offensive security. Most of my time is spent hunting vulnerabilities, poking at software, and spotting the things that look like they should be broken. Spoiler alert: they usually are.

This blog is where I share some of the projects, experiments, and R&D that i do in my spare time.

If offensive security and random write-ups spark your interest, you’re in the right place. Here, you’ll find technical insights and, occasionally, the personal stories behind my work.
